    **Important Note:**  
    _These models are not ready for clinical use "as is", but they represent the highest level of performance currently achievable on public benchmarks, outperforming Google‚Äôs Med-Gemini, and are pretrained open foundation models that health and life sciences organizations can customize, adapt, and deploy for their specific use cases programatically or through Azure AI Studio._

    ### ‚öïÔ∏è Available Models:  
      
    #### **MedImageParse**:    
    A biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object.

    #### **CxRReportGen**: (_Coming Soon_)    
    This model is built to help an application interpret complex medical imaging studies of chest X-rays. When built upon and integrated into an application, CXRReportGen may help developers generate comprehensive and structured radiology reports, with visual grounding represented by bounding boxes on the images.

    #### **PRISM**: (_Coming Soon_)   
    A multi-modal generative foundation model for slide-level analysis of H&E-stained histopathology images. Utilizing Virchow tile embeddings and clinical report texts for pre-training, PRISM combines these embeddings into a single slide embedding and generates a text-based diagnostic report. These can be used for tasks such as cancer detection, sub-typing, and biomarker identification.
